\subsection{Conclusion on applications of long distance \glsentryshort{wpt}}
Long distance \gls{wpt} offers many advantages, such as allowing transmission of sun energy harvested at higher efficiency by satellites in orbit of Earth, and to power drones in applications where longer flight times are required e.g. surveillance. Long distance \gls{wpt} can also be used to power \glspl{haps} while solar energy is unavailable. \glspl{haps} provides a way to deploy communication and surveillance networks in regions where ground based networks are not possible or available. A pre-built \gls{haps} and ground station could be a relatively quick way of reinstating a communications network in a region after a natural catastrophe.

Common for all the different applications of long distance \gls{wpt} is the need for precise tracking and pointing of antennas or lasers to ensure high efficiency when transferring energy. In some applications the transmitter and receiver will move relative to each other e.g. when charging a moving surveillance drone. For applications like these the pointing and tracking systems must both be quick and precise.
