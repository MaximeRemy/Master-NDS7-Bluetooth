\chapter{\glsentrylong{wpt}} \label{ch:WPTPreanalysis}
The method of \gls{wpt} has many applications. Numerous power transferring technologies exist eg.~inductive coupling, capacitive coupling and power transmission via radiowaves or concentrated lasers \citep{book:shinohara}. The first two are effective in short range. However to expand the applications of wireless power transfer to longer distances, radiowaves and concentrated lasers are more efficient \citep{book:shinohara}.

Long distance \gls{wpt} can reduce the need for high battery capacity in many applications due to the possibility to recharge them periodically.
QI and Qualcom are two companies who already have implemented wireless charging over short distances, mostly for small consumer electronics such as mobile phones, tablets and wearable technology \citep{web:QI} \citep{web:Qualcom}. 

However the \gls{wpt} application could be expanded by using a directional radio wave beam \citep{book:shinohara}. Some of its possible applications could be to power a target from afar or to transfer solar power to earth from a satellite \citep{sci_art:andrea}. 

This project begins by analyzing different methods of \gls{wpt} to determine their feasibility when transferring power wirelessly over long distances. A range of different applications for long distance \gls{wpt} is examined afterwards to identify use cases as well as challenges or problems in implementing them for long distance.

\section{Applications of long distance \glsentryshort{wpt}}
Applications of long distance \gls{wpt} ranges from beaming several \si{\giga\watt} of microwave power from solar power satellites to Earth over a distance of several thousands of \si{\kilo\meter}, to  applications which powers drones flying at an altitude of approximately 20-\SI{50}{\meter}.

This project will examine three different applications which either do benefit or could benefit from long distance \gls{wpt}. The three applications are \glspl{haps}, solar power satellites and drones.
