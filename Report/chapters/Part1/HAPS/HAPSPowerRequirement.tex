HAPS as network stations have three main sources of power consumption. The first and biggest one is the rotary engine allowing the HAPS to remain stationary (a necessity for any network station where the quality of services is dependent of the immobility of the station). Someone evaluated the peak consumption to \SI{90}{kW} for  an airship to remain stationary. The second comes from the payload of the network (generally estimated around 15 to \SI{20}{kW}). At last 10 \SI{10}{kW} is needed for miscellaneous task in the airship such as pressure regulation and lights for a total of around \SI{115}{kW} if we consider that night has an average of 12 hours then a HAPS has to get \SI{1380}{kWh} from the battery.

During the day the solar energy is enough to power entirely the HAPS. However at night the HAPS has currently for sole solution to power itself with batteries since the distance HAPS-ground too huge for any wire powering and eolian energy is too random.
