As of now the main viable option for HAPS to function at night is to rely on batteries. A typical lithium ion battery have a density of energy of around 

fuel cells : ~ 3.9 kWh/kg
lithium ion battery : ~ 5.8 kWh/kg

=>for \SI{1380}{kWh} need :
-	115/1.4 = 82.1 kg solar panel
-	1380/(350 Wh/kg) = 3942 kg lithium ion battery or 3.9 tonnes

\begin{equation}
	\frac{1380}{\SI{350}{\watt\hour\per\kilogram}}
\end{equation}
