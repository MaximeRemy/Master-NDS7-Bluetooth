In the close future HAPS should be mainly used for improving the network coverage and efficiency. Currently the solution to power them is solar energy, however as a network station it has to function at night. For this, they have to possess enough battery or to be powered by something else. Since the distance HAPS ground is enormous the most popular solution is currently the battery but the goal of this project is to power it wirelessly from earth alleviate the HAPS from the battery weight.
