\subsection{Photovoltaic power transfer}\label{sec:PhotovoltaicPowerTransfer}
The photovoltaic power transfer makes use of light to transfer power wirelessly. The power sending station transforms electrical energy into light, which is directed in form of a beam to the receiving station.

At the power receiving station the energy stored in the light beam is obtained and transformed back to electrical energy using a photovoltaics cell (solar panel).

The efficiency of the power transfer is mostly determined by the efficiency in conversion to a light beam and the photovoltaic cells. However current photovoltaic cells are not very efficient. \SI{34.5}{\percent} efficiency is considered as one of highest efficiency available on the market \citep{News:most_efficient_solar_cells_ever}.% (Source: http://www.sciencealert.com/engineers-just-created-the-most-efficient-solar-cells-ever)\todo[author=Daniel, inline]{ Add to bib}.

Photovoltaic power transfer is found to be very impractical. For the method to work, the power sending station is to hit the power receiving station with a light beam. If an object e.g a bird or the skies block the light beam from reaching its destination, the transfer fails.
