\subsection{Inductive coupling} \label{sec:InductiveCoupling}
Inductive coupling consists of two electrically conductive coils placed adjacent to each other at a fixed distance. 

Inductive coupling works by creating a fast changing magnetic field around the power transmitting coil, it is achieved by applying an alternating current to the coil. 
If the power receiving coil is placed within the changing magnetic field, an electric current will be inducted in the power receiving coil, thus transferring electrical energy wirelessly from one coil to the other coil. 
%In order to have the highest efficiency the power receiving coil have to be placed where the magnetic field is strongest.  

An illustration of inductive coupling setup is seen on \autoref{fig:InductiveCouplingSetup}.

Inductive coupling is shown to have a very high efficiency at short range, which dramatically falls when the range is increased \citep{website:Analysis_of_Wireless_Power_Transmission}. To expand the range of the inductive coupling, resonant circuits can be introduced to carry the magnetic field further. This is called resonant coupling.
