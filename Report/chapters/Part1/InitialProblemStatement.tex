\section{Initial problem statement}
%\todo[author=Alexander]{This section has to be rewritten to coherent text.}


%This is demonstrated by having a ground station locate and track a drone. The ground station should also be able to transfer power wirelessly to the drone. 

Before starting to design a ground station to power a HAPS is it needed to research the HAPS further. 

After the HAPS is research some technical knowledge is going to be needed as well. 


%In order to find the best possible solution to the project proposal some topics are to be researched before the design phase begins. 

%The topics needed to be researched are listed below: 
%\paragraph{What is a HAPS?}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item What is its physical shape and size?
%%\item At what altitudes do it operate?
%\item How much does it move?
%\item How much power is to be transferred to/from the HAPS? 
%%\item Why is it needed?
%%\item What does it do?
%%\item How much power is needed?
%%\item Satellite, high altitude balloons, UAV
%\end{itemize}
%
%
%\paragraph{How can precision position or trajectory tracking be done?} 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item How to orient the platform to optimize the tracking of the HAPS/quadcopter with the laser? 
%\item What options for tracking are available? 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Optical tracking?
%\item Radio tracking?
%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item Beacon?
%%\item RADAR / LIDAR?
%%\end{itemize}
%\item Other possibilities?
%\end{itemize}
%\end{itemize}
%
%\paragraph{Which methods can be used to transfer power wirelessly?}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Inductive coupling
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Magnetic fields between coils of wire 
%\end{itemize}
%\item Resonant coupling
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Inductive coupling with additional circuits
%\end{itemize}
%\item Microwave?
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Electromagnetic Radiation Approach 
%\item Concentrated and directional laser beam 
%\item Microwave source, waveguide
%\end{itemize}
%\item Capacitive coupling 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Electrical fields between metal plates
%\end{itemize}
%\item Photovoltaic power transfer
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Convert light to energy with semiconductors 
%\end{itemize}
%%\end{itemize}
%\item Which regulations exist?
%\begin{itemize}
%\item How much Power is allowed to be transferred?
%\item What frequency is allowed to be used? 
%\end{itemize}
%%\item Compare 
%%\item Efficiency % 
%%\item Max power transfer? 
%%\item Other implementations, is the technology used elsewhere? 
%%\item Max range? 
%%\item Maintenance?
%%\item Is it possible for us to implement this technology?
%%\item Can we scale?
%\end{itemize}
%
%%\paragraph{How do we communicate with the HAPS/quadcopter?}
%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item BT
%%\item Wi-Fi
%%\item Regulations in long range communication?
%%\end{itemize}
